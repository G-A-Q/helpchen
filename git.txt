A simple guide to install Git on a local machine:

1. Download Git: Go to the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install Git: Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions. Accept the default settings unless you have specific preferences.

3. Verify Installation: After the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal window and type `git --version`. If Git is installed correctly, it will display the version number.

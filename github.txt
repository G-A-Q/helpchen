- Go to GitHub.com and click on the Sign up button in the top right corner.
- Enter your username, email address, and password.

To clone a repo to your local machine, you need to have Git installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

Once you have Git, you can clone a repo using the command line or a graphical interface. 
- To clone a repo using HTTPS, copy the URL of the repo from the Code button on GitHub.com, open a terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repo, and type `git clone` followed by the URL. For example:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
